# 2D-Terrain-Generation

This is my project about 2D Terrain Generation using p5.js

## What tool am i using for generation?

I am using 2D perlin noise values.

## How do you create Terrain?

I am accessing every pixel of screen and painting them according to perlin noise value. after that i multiply noise values by 255 (RGB Color Limit). i set intervals so in that intervals every pixel will be colorred according to perlin noise values. (((You can find more in sketch.js)));

## Any Updates planned?

yes :)
